# Cloudflare DNS Zone Synchronization Modes
#
# The variable `dns_sync_mode` controls how local DNS zone definitions and remote Cloudflare
# DNS zone data are merged. Each mode defines a specific strategy for handling differences
# between local and remote DNS entries.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  Mode: fetch_prefer_local
#   • Merges all zones and DNS entries from both local and remote sources.
#   • If a record exists in both, the local record takes precedence.
#   • Useful for keeping all data but preferring local overrides.
#
#  Mode: fetch_prefer_remote
#   • Merges all zones and DNS entries from both local and remote sources.
#   • If a record exists in both, the remote record takes precedence.
#   • Useful when remote data should override local definitions.
#
#  Mode: fetch_defined_entries_prefer_local
#   • Includes only DNS entries that exist in both local and remote definitions.
#   • If a record exists in both, the local version is preferred.
#   • Useful for syncing only overlapping entries, keeping local values.
#
#  Mode: fetch_defined_entries_prefer_remote
#   • Includes only DNS entries that exist in both local and remote definitions.
#   • If a record exists in both, the remote version is preferred.
#   • Useful for syncing only overlapping entries, keeping remote values.
#
#  Mode: fetch_defined_zones_prefer_local
#   • Includes only zones that exist locally (zones not defined locally are ignored).
#   • For these zones, merge all DNS entries from local and remote.
#   • If a record exists in both, the local record takes precedence.
#   • Useful when you want to sync only specific zones under local control.
#
#  Mode: fetch_defined_zones_prefer_remote
#   • Includes only zones that exist locally (zones not defined locally are ignored).
#   • For these zones, merge all DNS entries from local and remote.
#   • If a record exists in both, the remote record takes precedence.
#   • Useful when you want to sync specific zones but keep remote as authoritative.
